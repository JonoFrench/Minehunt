# Minehunt
iOS Objective-C Minehunt Game built using SpriteKit and Paintcode. 

I originally wrote the first version of this a few years ago using Cocoas2d
It's now been updated to use Spritekit and all the graphics used have been 
created using Paintcode as vector images and exported as code to produce device
independant images.

Scroll left right on the menu to select game.
Harder games are better suited to an iPad.
To play, find all the hidden mines and drop flags on them.
Single Tap to see whats down there, clues are given as to how many bombs 
surround a tile.
Double tap to place a flag on a square
single tap again to mark with a ? if your not sure
single tap again to remove a ? and restore tile to blank
Hit a mine with a single tap and the lot blow up.

ToDo
Improve the Hi Scores table
Add instructions to game
Improve some of the vector images... I'm no Artist :-)
